### Write effective instructions

CLAUDE.md files are loaded into the context window at the start of every session, consuming tokens alongside your conversation. The [context window visualization](/docs/en/context-window) shows where CLAUDE.md loads relative to the rest of the startup context. Because they're context rather than enforced configuration, how you write instructions affects how reliably Claude follows them. Specific, concise, well-structured instructions work best.

**Size**: target under 200 lines per CLAUDE.md file. Longer files consume more context and reduce adherence. If your instructions are growing large, use [path-scoped rules](#path-specific-rules) so instructions load only when Claude works with matching files. You can also split content into [imports](#import-additional-files) for organization, though imported files still load and enter the context window at launch.

**Structure**: use markdown headers and bullets to group related instructions. Claude scans structure the same way readers do: organized sections are easier to follow than dense paragraphs.

**Specificity**: write instructions that are concrete enough to verify. For example:

* "Use 2-space indentation" instead of "Format code properly"
* "Run `npm test` before committing" instead of "Test your changes"
* "API handlers live in `src/api/handlers/`" instead of "Keep files organized"

**Consistency**: if two rules contradict each other, Claude may pick one arbitrarily. Review your CLAUDE.md files, nested CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories, and [`.claude/rules/`](#organize-rules-with-claude/rules/) periodically to remove outdated or conflicting instructions. In monorepos, use [`claudeMdExcludes`](#exclude-specific-claude-md-files) to skip CLAUDE.md files from other teams that aren't relevant to your work.
